# Hammerspoon Configuration

## Background
See the [Hammerspoon Website](https://www.hammerspoon.org/). It allows you to write Lua scripts that interact with the MacOS Operating System.
I use this to set keyboard shortcuts for adjusting Windows. Think of Windows, how holding down the Windows Key and pressing the right arrow key to move the browser to the right of the screen.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
"Command" + "Option" + "Control" = "->"                  : Move currently focused window to the right half of the screen.\
"Command" + "Option" + "Control" = "<-"                  : Move currently focused window to the left half of the screen.\
"Command" + "Option" + "Control" = "Up Arrow"      : Set the currently focused window to be the full size of the screen.\
"Command" + "Option" + "Control" = "Down Arrow" : Move currently focused window the bottom of the screen so you can only see the top of the window. (Don't ask me why I implemented this).\

```
"Command" + "Option" + "Control" = "->"         : Move currently focused window to the right half of the screen.
"Command" + "Option" + "Control" = "<-"         : Move currently focused window to the left half of the screen.
"Command" + "Option" + "Control" = "Up Arrow"   : Set the currently focused window to be the full size of the screen.
"Command" + "Option" + "Control" = "Down Arrow" : Move currently focused window the bottom of the screen
                                                  so you can only see the top of the window. (Don't ask me why I implemented this).
